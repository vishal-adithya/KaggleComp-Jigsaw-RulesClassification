Look into tianeptine, which does the opposite of the drug you are taking now, as well as cyproheptadine. Do not trust doctors. High serotonin is the cause of depression, and you're on drugs that raise it. Do your own research, using pub med.  Or you could message me :),Subreddit: depression,Positive Examples: You don't have to give a boyfriend notice if he isn't on the lease; you can kick him out any time he makes you feel unsafe or creeped out. Refund him his share of the rent, pro-rated. When he is out of the house, remove his things and have that supportive landlord get the locks changed. You don't have to put up with this. He can take you to court if he wants to; you don't have to live in a situation that makes you feel like you aren't safe., He should be able to handle stress better and not mistreat you. FYI stress get to everyone but no one acts this dickish unless they already were a dick. Dont write the letter tell him its over amd get a roomate to help pay house bills. If he refuses to leave contact a lwayer to see about finding options to evict him / what are your options. He pretty much is a deadweight. Don't let him sink/drown you. , Negative Examples: Why should I care about all the bicyclists I intentionally run off the road every year?, It's not so much that I killed them, it's that I didn't successfully save them. It was in Afghanistan in 2009, I had a few people die while treating them.
